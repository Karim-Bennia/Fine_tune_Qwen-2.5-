# Fine-Tuning Qwen-2.5 with Unsloth for Faster Code/JSON Generation ðŸš€
Project Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning Qwen-2.5, a powerful LLM, using Unsloth for optimized and efficient training. The goal is to transform natural language queries into structured JSON-based outputs.

Example
Hereâ€™s a quick demonstration of how a simple text query is converted into a structured JSON format:

**Input**  
"Apple unveils new iPhone model"

**Output**  
```json
{
  "type": "news_headline",
  "operationCode": "&&",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "condition",
      "operationCode": "=",
      "operand": "headline",
      "value": "Apple unveils new iPhone model"
    }
  ]
}
